// You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

// Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

// Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

// Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

// Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
// #Input

// A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

// #Output

// The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

// You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

// Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

// likes [] // must be "no one likes this"
// likes ["Peter"] // must be "Peter likes this"
// likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] // must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
// likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] // must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
// likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] // must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
// For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases.

// Adding tip to a restaurant bill in a graceful way can be tricky, thats why you need make a function for it.

// The function will receive the restaurant bill (always a positive number) as an argument. You need to 1) add at least 15% in tip, 2) round that number up to an elegant value and 3) return it.

// What is an elegant number? It depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded. Numbers below 10 should simply be rounded to whole numbers. Numbers 10 and above should be rounded like this:

// 10 - 99.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 5

// 100 - 999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 50

// 1000 - 9999.99... ---> Round to number divisible by 500

// And so on...

// Good luck!

Number of people in the bus
There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.

// You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

// Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D

// Take a look on the test cases.

// Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.

// The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

var number = function(busStops){
  let ppl = 0
  for(let i = 0; i < busStops.length; i++){
    ppl = ppl + busStops[i][0] - busStops[i][1]
  }
  return ppl

// The museum of incredible dull things
// The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

// Examples
// removeSmallest([1,2,3,4,5]) = [2,3,4,5]
// removeSmallest([5,3,2,1,4]) = [5,3,2,4]
// removeSmallest([2,2,1,2,1]) = [2,2,2,1]
