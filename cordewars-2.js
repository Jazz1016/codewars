// (If you're not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)

// Note: Of course you can't do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P

// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// isSquare(-1) returns  false
// isSquare(0) returns   true
// isSquare(3) returns   false
// isSquare(4) returns   true
// isSquare(25) returns  true
// isSquare(26) returns  false

// You are currently in the United States of America. The main currency here is known as the United States Dollar (USD). You are planning to travel to another country for vacation, so you make it today's goal to convert your USD (all bills, no cents) into the appropriate currency. This will help you be more prepared for when you arrive in the country you will be vacationing in.

// Given an integer (usd) representing the amount of dollars you have and a string (currency) representing the name of the currency used in another country, it is your task to determine the amount of foreign currency you will receive when you exchange your United States Dollars.

// However, there is one minor issue to deal with first. The screens and monitors at the Exchange are messed up. Some conversion rates are correctly presented, but other conversion rates are incorrectly presented. For some countries, they are temporarily displaying the standard conversion rate in the form of a number's binary representation!

// You make some observations. If a country's currency begins with a vowel, then the conversion rate is unaffected by the technical difficulties. If a country's currency begins with a consonant, then the conversion rate has been tampered with.

// Normally, the display would show 1 USD converting to 111 Japanese Yen. Instead, the display is showing 1 USD converts to 1101111 Japanese Yen. You take it upon yourself to sort this out. By doing so, your 250 USD rightfully becomes 27750 Japanese Yen.

// Normally, the display would show 1 USD converting to 21 Czech Koruna. Instead, the display is showing 1 USD converts to 10101 Czech Koruna. You take it upon yourself to sort this out. By doing so, your 325 USD rightfully becomes 6825 Czech Koruna.
