// Have you heard about the myth that if you fold a paper enough times, you can reach the moon with it? Sure you do, but exactly how many? Maybe it's time to write a program to figure it out.

// You know that a piece of paper has a thickness of 0.0001m. Given distance in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper reach this distance.
// (If you're not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)

// Note: Of course you can't do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P

// Also, if somebody is giving you a negative distance, it's clearly bogus and you should yell at them by returning null (or whatever equivalent in your language. In Shell please return None).

function foldTo(distance) {
  var counter = 0;

  if (distance < 0) {
    return null;
  }

  for (var i = 0.0001; i < distance; i) {
    i *= 2;
    counter += 1;
  }

  return counter;
}

// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// isSquare(-1) returns  false
// isSquare(0) returns   true
// isSquare(3) returns   false
// isSquare(4) returns   true
// isSquare(25) returns  true
// isSquare(26) returns  false

var isSquare = function(n) {
  return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n));
};

// The code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// Write a function that accepts two arguments: an array/list of integers and another integer (n).

// Determine the number of times where two integers in the array have a difference of n.

// For example:

// [1, 1, 5, 6, 9, 16, 27], n=4  -->  3  # (1,5), (1,5), (5,9)
// [1, 1, 3, 3], n=2             -->  4  # (1,3), (1,3), (1,3), (1,3)
// FUNDAMENTALS

const intDiff = (arr, n) => {
  console.log(arr);
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      console.log(arr[i], arr[j], n, count);
      if (arr[i] - arr[j] === n) {
        count++;
      } else if (arr[j] - arr[i] === n) {
